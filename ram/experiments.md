* How memory is allocated in Linux?

* How to check exact memory used by a process in Linux? To the byte level granularity

* What is RES (Resident Set Size) and VIRT (Virtual Memory Size) and SHR (Shared Memory Size)?
* How are we able to allocate 9GB+ RAM using malloc() in C, in a 4GB RAM machine?

* What is Swap memory? Memory from files? Like, from disk? Like, from storage?

* If memory is allocated in C program using malloc() but not freed using free() and later the process / program crashes or is killed in a normal way, does the Linux kernel take back the allocated RAM from the process? Or will it show as RAM still being used by the process? Ideally, RAM usage is all about what's happening when a program is running, right?

* Can you take snapshot of the RAM usage of a program? To see what's there in the RAM, the data, the in-memory data

* Exhaust RAM in Linux using C program
* Exhaust RAM in Linux using C++ program

* Try out malloc() in C
* Try out calloc() in C
* Try out realloc() in C
* Try out free() in C
* Try out free() in C where the pointer is NOT pointing to the first byte of the dynamically allocated memory block
* Try out new() in C++
* Try out delete in C++
